#Reason for design build
A contemporary spin on a classic arcade game, presented as a cross-platform mobile app.
I wanted to create a flying game that was similar to flappy bird and other classic space ship flying games, in that it allows for appearance of gravity and the scrolling platformer screen. This relates to my creative cards which was metal and owl. The placeholders at the moment are that of the base tutorial I used to get to grips with kivy and the use of "physics". After this draft I want to replace this placeholders which original graphics.

#Update
The current build has improved on the tutorial by:  
-including own audio for death
-included own graphics for player and spikes(replace pipes)
-changed random x position of obsticles
-allowed players to touch ground
-restricted players to not move out of screen

#To do:
-change graphics of ground and background
-limited number of flaps
-on screen collectables to boost stamina
-in air projectiles for obsticles
-platforms for player to be reset flaps/rest
