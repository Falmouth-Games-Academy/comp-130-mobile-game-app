####Creativity cards:

* Truck  

####Arcade game: 
* Frogger

####Resources used:
* [Truck images](http://opengameart.org/content/trucks)
* Background image (made by me)
* Sounds generated on [superflashbros](http://www.superflashbros.net/as3sfxr/)
* Sounds generated by my COMP120 tinkering audio program
* The source code is based off this [Pong code tutorial](https://kivy.org/docs/tutorials/pong.html)

My Kivy App is based on Frogger, I've changed it so instead of a frog there is a person and car/leap pads are replaced with trucks.

The code was based on the [Pong code tutorial](https://kivy.org/docs/tutorials/pong.html) from the Kivy website.

My intial screen designs show the layout I intend to use which is based off of the Frogger layout:
