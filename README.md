###Sprints:
Below are th four sprint plans used throughout this project. For each sprint the cards in the Done column are tasks completed in the previous sprint, cards in the Review column are the tasks that were completed in the current sprint, the cards in the In Progress column are that tasks that were not finished in that sprint so were moved to the next sprint and the cards in the Backlog are tasks taht will be completed in future sprints.

####Sprint 1:

I removed the lives system as it was better to take points off the score for collisions. Previously the score didn't vary much as the window size remained the same so minusing points from the score and adding a time bonus appeared to be better than having a sepeate lives system.  
I didn't finish randomly generating the trucks in this sprint so they've been moved to the next sprint.

####Sprint 3:

The trucks are now randomly generated that only task not acheived in this sprint was to make the game end when the timer reached zero, that task has been moved to the next sprint.

####Sprint 4:
