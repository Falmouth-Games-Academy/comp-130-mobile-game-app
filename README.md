# comp-130-mobile-game-app
A contemporary spin on a classic arcade game, presented as a cross-platform mobile app.

I used a tutorial on wordpress to make this game, it showed me step by step instructions on how to make a base flappy bird clone
I twisted it on itself. From the get go the program had many errors from the tutorial I had to fix all of them in order to get it working.
