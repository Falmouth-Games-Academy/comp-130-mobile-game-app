# comp-130-mobile-game-app
A contemporary spin on a classic arcade game, presented as a cross-platform mobile app.

####Creativity cards: 
* Apocalpyse  
* Truck  

####Arcade game: 
* Frogger

My Kivy App is based on Frogger, I've changed it so instead of a frog there is a person and card/leap pads are replaced with trucks. The colour scheme was inspired by the apocalpyse creativity card.

The code was based on the [Pong code tutorial](https://kivy.org/docs/tutorials/pong.html) from the Kivy website.

My intial screen designs show the layout I intend to use which is based off of the Frogger layout:
