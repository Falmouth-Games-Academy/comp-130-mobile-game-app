# comp-130-mobile-game-app
A contemporary spin on a classic arcade game, presented as a cross-platform mobile app.

Creativity cards: Apocalpyse & Truck  
Arcade game: Frogger

Based on [Pong code](https://kivy.org/docs/tutorials/pong.html) from the Kivy.org website.

My Kivy App is based on Frogger, I've adapted the Pong code and changed it so instead of a frog there is a person and card/leap pads are replaced with trucks. The colour scheme was inspired by the apocalpyse creativity card.
